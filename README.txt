Project Title: The Crowd Dynamic– How Does Opinion Spread in a Network? 

Project Description: 
The project idea is to create a mathematical model that can accurately model the spread of opinion in crowds. 
Crowd wisdom is especially difficult to model due to the seeming randomness of individual behaviors, but can we 
gain a glimpse into how wisdom forms through study of opinion formation? It is possible to design a network of 
individuals and consider a game played on each edge to determine the decisions that are made by each individual. 
Games on certain clusters and sequences of decisions can impact group behavior as well. The goal is to create a 
weighted model that considers all of these phenomena that influence group behavior and predict group proportions
on decisions (and see group decisions). The plan is to test the model by creating a simulation and see if there 
exists a pattern of opinion spread. 

Project Concepts: Graph/Graph Algorithms, Social Networks, Game Theory/Auctions/Matching Markets (specifically 
mixed strategy nash equilibrium)

The model is driven by graph theory and degree measures and the influence of
decisions of others on personal decisions (game theory). Games will be played on edges of the network between 
each player. In an iterative process, the payoff functions of each game will be updated after each round of 
“play” by considering the degree of each node in its respective game.
